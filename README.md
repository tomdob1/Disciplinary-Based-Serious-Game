# Disciplinary-Based-Serious-Game
A Serious Game created in my final year at university using Unity and Fungus, aimed at simulating the role of a manager partaking in disciplinary based meetings.

This game aims at utilising the communication competency to demonstrate when it is most appropriate to use the direct, friendly, aggressive and open communication styles based on the recipients social cues and the objective set by the board meeting.

The aim of the game is to achieve either a board happiness or team happiness score of 10 by the end of the set game length to achieve a promotion. If either of the variables reach a score of 0 at any point the player loses the game.

To achieve a positive score for board happiness, the user must select the appropriate communication style and dialogue to meet the objective set out by the board.

To achieve a positive score for team happiness, an appropriate communication style and dialogue must be selected which is in line with the recipients social cues.
